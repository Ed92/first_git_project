Emmet
-----

  Thank you for installing Emmet -- a toolkit that can greatly improve your workflow. Note that this plugin automatically downloads and installs PyV8 binary (see status bar message). 
  
  ******************************
  Please restart editor 
  to finish installation process 
  after PyV8 was downloaded.
  ******************************
  
  Tab key handler
  ==========================
  
  By default, Emmet allows you to expand abbreviations with Tab key in HTML, XML, HAML and CSS/SASS/LESS/Stylus documents. As a side effect, you can’t use some of your ST2 snippets.
  
  Please read https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime#tab-key-handler about how Tab handler works and how to tweak its behavior to match your needs.
  
  Enter key
  ==========================
  
  In HTML and XML documents, Emmet overrides Enter key to insert formatted line breaks between opening and closing tags. In some cases it will break character input (for example, in Japanese language).
  
  To disable Enter key handler, simply add the following option in your user's Preferences file:
  
  "disable_formatted_linebreak": true
  
  Actions shortcuts
  ==========================
  
  Emmet has a number of actions with keyboard shortcuts that may override ones you're using commonly (for example, Ctrl-E or Ctrl-Down). Please read the project main page to get list of available actions and keyboard shortcuts and how to disable them:

  Welcome to SublimeLinter, a linter framework for Sublime Text 3.
  
                   * * * IMPORTANT! * * *
  
          Linters *NOT* included with SublimeLinter 3,
          they must be installed separately.
  
                  * * * READ THE DOCS! * * *
  
  Otherwise you will never know how to install linters, nor will
  you know about all of the great new features in SublimeLinter 3.

CSS3
----

  Thank you for installing CSS3!
  
  This plugin requires Sublime Text 3 build 3103 or greater.
  
  You must disable the default CSS package. It will interfere with CSS3.
  
      Mac:       cmd+shift+p  -> Package Control: Disable Package -> CSS
      Linux/Win: ctrl+shift+p -> Package Control: Disable Package -> CSS
  
  I also strongly recommend adding these two settings to your User Settings (the
  general settings, not the package settings). By default, Sublime will not offer
  completions inside other completions. In other words, the completions menu is
  suppressed when you're tabbing through a snippet. This blocks most of the CSS3
  completions from appearing. To fix this, set these keys to true:
  
      "auto_complete_commit_on_tab": true,
      "auto_complete_with_fields": true,
  
  If you have Emmet installed, its completions will drown out the carefully
  researched, standards-based completions offered by this package. You can hide
  Emmet completions without disabling them by adding this line to your Emmet
  package settings.
  
      "show_css_completions": false // strongly recommended
  
  That's it. Enjoy the plugin. If you have any problems, please open an issue on
  GitHub. Thanks!

Color Highlighter
-----------------

  
  Color Highlighter v8.0 is released!
  
  For more info about the plugin visit https://github.com/Monnoroch/ColorHighlighter.
  
  Color Highlighter was developed for many years and features were added without consideration.
  As a result it has plenty of bugs and code is completely unmaintainable.
  Because of it, I've decided to rewrite the plugin from scratch using all the good programming practices I learned
  over the years.
  
  This is the first release of the new version and it might have some subtle bugs, especially on Windows and Mac, as I
  don't have machines with these systems. If you find any bugs, please file them in
  the bug tracker here: https://github.com/Monnoroch/ColorHighlighter/issues. I always appreciate your help and try to fix
  problems as soon as possible.
  
  The plugin is being developed by me alone in my spare time, so if you want to encourage me to build it
  better and faster, donations as always welcome.
  
  Thank you guys for your support, every little bit helps!
